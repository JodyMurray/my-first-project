## Design

After completing the diploma for which this project was originally created, I am now revisiting it to enhance both the project itself and my skills. The project's design was initially inspired by the Love Running project during the course.

The primary goal for this website remains to achieve a clean and visually appealing look with a carefully selected colour scheme, chosen to complment the prevalent green theme associated with dragons, which are prominently featured in Robin Hobb's books.

The website consists of three pages, each accessible through links located at the top in the header of every HTML page.  As I return to this project, my intention is to refine and expand upon these features while honing my web development skills.

## Colour Scheme





## Typography

- The fonts used for this project were from https://fonts.google.com/
- Icons for the social media links from https://fontawesome.com/
- The fonts used for the headings: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif.
- The fonts used for body: 'Nunito', sans-serif.
- The fonts used for the heading "Chrononlogical Order" were Cursive and 'parisienne'.

## Images

Images have been chosen in accordance to colour and content. The purpose of the website is to give a friendly look and express quality. Images have been sized in order to match design and consistency.

## Features

- Header and Navigation Bar
- Hero Image
- Welcome

## Testing and Bugs

Test has been conducted using Google Chrome, testing different devices and screen resolutions through google dev tools.
Listed is the main bugs I came across.

1. The pictures gave me issues trying to get them the correct size. Especially for the responsive screen design.

- Solution; find the best photos, all the same sizes for the hero images, or change their resolution to match each other.
- The biography photo had to be changed quite a few times.

2. The youtube video and map were a bit problematic as well. The video on the Home page is very long and I couldn't manage to get it right.

- Solution; have video in a separate div/section, or change the autofilled width and height that come with the link and amend in CSS.

3. The margins in the header were always affected by the margins in the reviews.

- Solution; Remove reviews.

4. For smaller screens, the Thank you image wasn't pushing the sub heading up and lining it with the other heading.

- Solution; Remove display of sub heading in thankyou.html.

5. The first CW3 test pointed out a few errors all to do with the images with the biography and youtube video.

- Solution; the images with the biography were just not working well with their sizes. Changed this photo to one instead of two and made it into a circle with border radius. The video was resolved by adding the correct display, width and height to each media query.

6. Responsive design doesn't work well when sliding the screen to a smaller size. Using the devtools to choose each screen size will work well.

- Solution; Used min-width for some of the media queries, which helped the screen transition a little.

7. Resolution in the image in the meetup section is still quite bad in the largest screen size.

- Solution; Changed height pixels and it seemed to work fine in most large screens.

8. A bug I came across was showing me no internet.

- Solution; it was a small error in the settings of the browser.

Two bugs for Firefox browser which I didn't find many solutions for:

9. Margin in the header for Firefox doesn't look the same as it does on Google Chrome, especially on the responsive design for 320px.
10. Last bug found on Firefox screen 1980x1080, menu bar didn't look right. Some of it was amended, the menu bar looks a bit off in this screen, but I will leave it as is, as it was the only way without changing some other things to fix it.

## Deployment

The development platform used for this project was GitPod. To track the development stage and handle version control regular commits and pushes to GitHub has been conducted. The GitPod environment was created using a template provided by Code Institute.

The live version of the project is deployed at GitHub pages.

The procedure for deployment followed the "Creating your site" steps provided in GitHub Docs.

*Log into Github.
*Select the correct GitHub Repository to be deployed live.
*Underneath the repository name, click the “Settings” option.
*In the sub-section list on the left, under “Code and automation”, click “Pages”.
*Within the ”Source” section choose ”main” as Branch and root as folder and click ”Save”.
*The page refreshes and a website shall then deploy via a link.
