 ## Design 
The design has been inspired by the Love Running project. The code for the header and footer in this project were influenced by the header and footer in   the Love Running Project.
The aim for this website is to create a clean looking website with an appealing colour scheme, my colours were chosen to go with the relative green in Dragons as they are heavily featured in these books. 
This website is three pages, all links included at the top in the header for each HTML page and at the bottom in the footer containing links to social media platforms to do with Robin Hobb. 
There is also a form-dump page, which brings up a thank you note when applying your email into the meetup section.

## Colour Scheme
My colour scheme I picked myself, I find them appealing to the eyes and relative to the fan page.
They are consisting of - A lighter colour for the reviews; #888E8E.
                       - A shade darker than the above one for the text; #4a4a4a, (a colour used in Love Running).
                       - A dark green shade for the headings; #719B43.
