This fan page style website was designed to inform people of the author Robin Hobb and her work. Shown through a biogography section and a page with her collection of series. Also included is a page for a fictional meetup based in Dublin that fans can apply for. 

This website contains three main pages; Home, Collection and Meetups. The Meetup page includes a section to enter your email address to sign up for the mentioned meetings held in Dublin.

Users of this website will be well informed about Robin Hobb through a biography and a video interview, they will see pictures and read summaries of each of her series, and quotes from famous reviews these books have received throughout the years. 
The target audience of this page is mostly existing fans but new fans of the author are also welcome. This is mentioned so everybody feels welcome and fans can meet likeminded fans of this fantasy world!

 ## Design 
The design has been inspired by the Love Running project. The code for the header and footer in this project were influenced by the header and footer in   the Love Running Project.
The aim for this website is to create a clean looking website with an appealing colour scheme, my colours were chosen to go with the relative green in Dragons as they are heavily featured in these books. 
This website is three pages, all links included at the top in the header for each HTML page and at the bottom in the footer containing links to social media platforms to do with Robin Hobb. 
There is also a form-dump page, which brings up a thank you note when applying your email into the meetup section.

                       - A shade darker than the above one for the text; #4a4a4a, (a colour used in Love Running).
                       - A dark green shade for the headings; #719B43.
