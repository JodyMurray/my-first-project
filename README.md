This fan page style website was designed to inform people of the author Robin Hobb and her work. Shown through a biogography section and a page with her collection of series. Also included is a page for a fictional meetup based in Dublin that fans can apply for. 

This website contains three main pages; Home, Collection and Meetups. The Meetup page includes a section to enter your email address to sign up for the mentioned meetings held in Dublin.

Users of this website will be well informed about Robin Hobb through a biography and a video interview, they will see pictures and read summaries of each of her series, and quotes from famous reviews these books have received throughout the years. 
The target audience of this page is mostly existing fans but new fans of the author are also welcome. This is mentioned so everybody feels welcome and fans can meet likeminded fans of this fantasy world!

This website is the first of five projects that needs to be completed in order to receive a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

Requirements for the project is that the website has to be static and responsive using HTML5 and CSS3.

A live version of the site can be found here: https://github.com/JodyMurray/my-first-project.git
