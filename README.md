This fan page style website was designed to inform people of the author Robin Hobb and her work. Shown through a biogography section and a page with her collection of series. Also included is a page for a fictional meetup based in Dublin that fans can apply for. 

This website contains three main pages; Home, Collection and Meetups. The Meetup page includes a section to enter your email address to sign up for the mentioned meetings held in Dublin.

Users of this website will be well informed about Robin Hobb through a biography and a video interview, they will see pictures and read summaries of each of her series, and quotes from famous reviews these books have received throughout the years. 
The target audience of this page is mostly existing fans but new fans of the author are also welcome. This is mentioned so everybody feels welcome and fans can meet likeminded fans of this fantasy world!

This website is the first of five projects that needs to be completed in order to receive a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

Requirements for the project is that the website has to be static and responsive using HTML5 and CSS3.

A live version of the site can be found here: https://jodymurray.github.io/my-first-project/

## Design 
The design has been inspired by the Love Running project. The code for the header and footer in this project were influenced by the header and footer in   the Love Running Project.
The aim for this website is to create a clean looking website with an appealing colour scheme, my colours were chosen to go with the relative green in Dragons as they are heavily featured in these books. 
This website is three pages, all links included at the top in the header for each HTML page and at the bottom in the footer containing links to social media platforms to do with Robin Hobb. 
There is also a form-dump page, which brings up a thank you note when applying your email into the meetup section.

## Colour Scheme
My colour scheme I picked myself, I find them appealing to the eyes and relative to the fan page.
They are consisting of - A lighter colour for the reviews; #888E8E.
                       - A shade darker than the above one for the text; #4a4a4a, (a colour used in Love Running).
                       - A dark green shade for the headings; #719B43.

## Typography

- Icons for the social media links from https://fontawesome.com/
- The fonts used for the headings: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif.
- The fonts used for body: 'Nunito', sans-serif.

## Testing and Bugs
Test has been conducted using Google Chrome, testing different devices and screen resolutions through google dev tools. 
Listed is the main bugs I came across.

1. The pictures gave me issues trying to get them the correct size. Especially for the responsive screen design.
 - Solution was to find the best photos, all the same sizes for the hero images, or change their resolution to match each other.
 - The biography photo had to be changed quite a few times. 
2. The youtube video and map were a bit problematic as well. 
 - Solution, have video in a separate div/section, or change the autofilled width and height that come with the link and amend in CSS.
3. Some bugs came about because I did the media query in the wrong order.
4. For smaller screens, removed the review quotes, they didn't work well with the header/logo shrinking.
5. For smaller screens, removed the 2nd logo heading, as the Thank you image wasn't pushing it up and lining it with the other heading. 
6. The first CW3 test pointed out a few errors all to do with the images with the biography and youtube video.
 - Solution, the images with the biography were just not working well with their sizes. Changed this photo to one instead of two and made it into a circle with border radius. The video was resolved by adding the correct display, width and height to each media query.
7. Responsive design doesn't work well when sliding the screen to a smaller size. Using the devtools to choose each screen size will work well.
8. Used a min-width as well as a max-width as it seemed to resolve a lot of issues when scrolling through screen sizes.
9. Resolution in the image in the meetup section is still quite bad in the largest screen size.
10. All these issues along with some minor ones were all resolved with some time and research.

## Deployment 
The development platform used for this project was GitPod. To track the development stage and handle version control regular commits and pushes to GitHub has been conducted. The GitPod environment was created using a template provided by Code Institute.

The live version of the project is deployed at GitHub pages.

The procedure for deployment followed the "Creating your site" steps provided in GitHub Docs.

*Log into Github.
*Select the correct GitHub Repository to be deployed live.
*Underneath the repository name, click the “Settings” option.
*In the sub-section list on the left, under “Code and automation”, click “Pages”.
*Within the ”Source” section choose ”main” as Branch and root as folder and click ”Save”.
*The page refreshes and a website shall then deploy via a link.
