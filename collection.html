    <h2 id="early-work">Robin Hobb's early work</h3>
    <p>The Farseer novels were the first works written as Robin Hobb, a pseudonym of American author Margaret Astrid Lindholm Ogden. Her earlier writing appeared under the name Megan Lindholm, in the genres of urban fantasy and science fiction. 
        Lindholm's work was critically well-received, including Hugo and Nebula Award nominations for her short fiction, but did not do as well in terms of sales. In 1995, the author shifted to writing secondary-world fantasy and adopted a new byline, Robin Hobb. 
        This was an intentionally androgynous name chosen to match the Fitz novels, which were written in a first-person male narrative voice.
        The series incubated over a number of years, with the core idea being: "What if magic were addictive? And what if the addiction was destructive or degenerative?". </p>
