    <h3 class="reviews">Robin Hobb's early work</h3>
    <p>The Farseer novels were the first works written as Robin Hobb, a pseudonym of American author Margaret Astrid Lindholm Ogden. Her earlier writing appeared under the name Megan Lindholm, in the genres of urban fantasy and science fiction. Lindholm's work was critically well-received, including Hugo and Nebula Award nominations for her short fiction, but did not do as well in terms of sales. In 1995, the author shifted to writing secondary-world fantasy and adopted a new byline, Robin Hobb. This was an intentionally androgynous name chosen to match the Fitz novels, which were written in a first-person male narrative voice.
        The series incubated over a number of years, with the core idea being: "What if magic were addictive? And what if the addiction was destructive or degenerative?". The first book had the working title Chivalry's Bastard, which was later changed to Assassin's Apprentice. Fitz's narrative was structured as a trilogy from the beginning, with Hobb stating that the story was too complex to fit in one book and naturally broke into three parts. The relationship between Fitz and the wolf Nighteyes was based on a half-wolf called Bruno that moved into Hobb's home in Alaska in the 1950s. The enigmatic character known as the Fool was initially not a big part of the series' outline, but grew into a major character as the novels were written. The Farseer books went on to be critically and commercially successful, and became the first of five series set in the Realm of the Elderlings, which concluded in 2017.</p>
